- figure out how to get permissoins working
- build endpoints to:
	- delete a card

- coors?
- proper sessions and refresh?
- do I need to keep track of the token?
- rate limiting
- cloudflare?
- use `fluent-json-schema` package for all schema probably
- figure out a way to generate schema from types
- look into relative routes etc.
- set up nice command to run everything, like nodemon, or that other tool

- reminder that I use the `rounded` version of material icons
